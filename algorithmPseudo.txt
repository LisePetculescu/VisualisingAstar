A* pseudo code

use Diagonal distance to calcultate heuristics for cells in A* when we can move i 8 directions
Manhattan is used when we can only move in 4 directions up-down, left-right
Euclidean is for when we can move in any direction

all 3 measures the distance from current cell to goal cell. 

i will use diagonal distance.
